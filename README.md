# The Shoppies
 UX Developer Intern & Web Developer Intern Challenge - Summer 2021

## About

This repo contains my submission to the Shopify Coding Challenge. Using a modern framework like React, I achieved a minimalist movie database with an effortless customer experience. 

#### Built With

- [Material UI](https://material-ui.com)
- [Shopify Polaris](https://polaris.shopify.com) (woohoo!) 
- [React](https://reactjs.org)

## Getting Started 

To get this running locally you will need to have the latest npm package manager. 

* npm
    
    ```npm install npm@latest -g```
    
#### Installation 

1. Clone the repo 
     
     ```git clone https://github.com/JosephDrazen/The-Shoppies--Movie-awards-for-entrepreneurs```
     
2. Install npm packages 
     
     ```npm install```
     
3. Run the app in localhost and enjoy
     
     ```npm start```

The main UI is done. However, some work needs to be done on the backend to ensure things are running smooth for the user :)
